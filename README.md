# log

Go logging library for GCP App Engine, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions:

- Encodes **severity** so that coloring works in the Google web-based Logs Explorer.
- **Zero dependencies**, it is a stdlib-only module. Nul, zilch, nada!
- Backward compatible as far as the ancient Go version 1.9 (tested with Go 1.9.7 on Ubuntu 16.04).
